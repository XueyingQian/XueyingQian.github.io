# Product Recommendation Project

This Project is identifing the top 5 co-purchased products of the input targeted product from a grocery store. 
I implemented the given dataset using pyspark in Jupyter notebook. To be specific, I extracted essential data such as product id into Spark dataframe; filtered, exploded, and counted the id list using SQL; and delivered the outcome table. I used python as the main tool to create local database, set up user input, clean row data, develop recommendation algorithm etc.
